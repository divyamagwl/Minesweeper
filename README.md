# Minesweeper

## Problem Faced
I am a minesweeper enthusiast. I love spending time on this game. 

At the same time my friends didn't even know the basic rules of the game because the classic game was not appealing to them and it also lacked basic instructions.

Consequently, I thought of implementing one of the most iconic games in computer history in my own way so that I could make it more appealing to everyone.


## Project Idea
You are presented with a board of squares. Some squares contain mines, others don't.
Prove your strategic skills and quick wits by clearing the board from all the mines.
 
This game features three levels - Easy, Medium, Hard.\newline 

Additionally, this game feature basic instructions to know how to play the game.

## Tech Stack
Python 3.6.9

PyGame 1.9.6

## Progress of the Project
The classic game never presented the rules properly so it could not involve more and more people to play and enjoy the game. So the first feature which I thought of implementing was the basic instructions page so as to make people understand the basic rules of the game.

The other features of this game are mostly inspired from the original game which provided features to reveal the number of neighbouring mines by left clicking on the square box and by right clicking the square box you can place a flag where you think is a mine.

Additionally the classic game never revealed the whole board at the end of the game however I thought why not just reveal the whole board at the end of the game so that people can amplify their game knowledge.

The main aim of my project was to make the GUI of the game more captivating so that it could even gather attention of young kids and they would engage in this strategic game which improves their mental ability.

## Future Prospects
I would love to add sounds in the game to make the game more engrossing and captivating.\newline
Also I would want to add a leader-board so that players can keep track of how much they have improved themselves over time by spending more and more time on this strategic brain enhancing game.
